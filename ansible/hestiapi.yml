##
# Prerequisites:
#   - you can SSH into the target machine as the remote_user without interaction
#   - remote_user can use sudo
#     - if a password is required, you'll need --ask-become-pass when deploying
#
# To deploy, fron the ansible directory:
#   ansible-playbook -i "192.168.0.68," hestiapi.yml
#
#   The example above uses 192.168.0.68 as the target machine. The comma at the
#   end is not a typo. That is what tells ansible this is a list of hosts and
#   not an inventory file.
#
# To deploy when SSH is using a non-standard port and ignore SSH host fingerprint
# changes (e.g. when deploying to a VM), the command would look something like:
#   ansible-playbook -i "localhost," --ssh-extra-args "-p 5022 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" hestiapi.yml
#
# Tested on:
#   - Debian 9 (stretch)
